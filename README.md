This repository contains the code and design parts for the new expansion microscopy setup at the Aparicio Lab.

The 'Final Shaker Parts' contains all the components used for 3D printing the shaker currently used in the lab.

The 'Peristaltic Pump Code' folder contains python files that can be used in order to run the perstaltic pump indepdently from the rest of the system. This folder was mainly used for testing purposes.

The 'Mechanical Components' folder contains all the solidworks part files used for developping the shaker used in the expansion microscopy setup. It also contains part files from older versions of the designs. The parts available in this folder can be used as a reference.

"Print 1" contains the STL files and drawings for the first iteration of 3D printing..

The "Boyden Lab Code" contains code from the Boyden for controlling their instruments when carrying out expansion microscopy. All of their code was written in Matlab.

Testing_servo.m contains code for controlling the servo motor angles in matlab.
