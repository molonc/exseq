This repository contains the code and design parts for the new expansion microscopy setup.

Note: The following python files: fluidics, GSIOC, and Serial_COM are from the old MERFISH system with the peristaltic pump.
GilsonMP3 can be run independently to control the persitaltic pump.

The folder named "mechanical_components" contains solidworks part files used for developping the shaker used in the expansion microscopy setup.
"Print 1" contains the STL files and drawings of the first round of printing.
The most important assembly to look at is: Shadi Discussed Smaller Design which contains all the parts used in the design.
