This repository contains the code and design parts for the new expansion microscopy setup.

The 'Peristaltic Pump Code' folder contains python files that can be used in order to run the perstaltic pump. The following python files: fluidics.py, GSIOC.py, and Serial_COM.py are from the old MERFISH system with the peristaltic pump.
GilsonMP3.py can be run independently to control the persitaltic pump.

The folder named "mechanical_components" contains all the solidworks part files used for developping the shaker used in the expansion microscopy setup. It also contains part files from older versions of the designs. The parts available in this folder can be used as a reference.

"Print 1" contains the STL files and drawings for the four components printed for the first time (small clamp, large clamp, platform, and servomotor mount).

The folder "key_mechanical_components" contains the parts that I am continuing to modify in order to optimize the design (as well as the assembly showing how all the parts fit together.

"Potential Platforms" contains part files for possible platforms to use for the shaker (they are all thorr labs components).

The "Boyden Lab Code" contains code from the Boyden for controlling their instruments when carrying out expansion microscopy. All of their code was written in Matlab.

Testing_servo.m contains code for controlling the servo motor angles.
