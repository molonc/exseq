# exseq
This repository contains the code and design parts for the new expansion microscopy setup at the Aparicio Lab. 

*USED IN FINAL SETUP The 'Final Shaker Parts' contains all the components used for 3D printing the shaker currently used in the lab.

*USED IN FINAL SETUP The 'Working exSeq Code' all the python scripts required to run expansion sequencing. You can do this by running the fluidics.py script which will open a user friendly GUI.

*TESTING The 'Peristaltic Pump Code' folder contains python files that can be used in order to run the perstaltic pump indepdently from the rest of the system. This folder was mainly used for testing purposes.

*TESTING The 'Mechanical Components' folder contains all the solidworks part files used for developping the shaker used in the expansion microscopy setup. It also contains part files from older versions of the designs. The parts available in this folder can be used as a reference.

*TESTING "Print 1" contains the STL files and drawings for the first iteration of 3D printing.

The "Boyden Lab Code" contains code from the Boyden for controlling their instruments when carrying out expansion microscopy. All of their code was written in Matlab.

*TESTING Maybe_servoexseq.py, servo_exseq.py, and servoex_seq_testing were used for testing the connection between the servomotor and the Arduino board.

*TESTING Testing_servo.m contains code for controlling the servo motor angles in matlab.
